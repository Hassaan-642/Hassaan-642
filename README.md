1. Knowledge:
• Define HTML and CSS.
• Identify the basic structure of an HTML document.
• Differentiate between HTML elements and attributes.
Task
• Read relevant sections from the provided learning material.
• Create a document summarizing the key terms and concepts related to HTML and
CSS.
Ans:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It enhances the appearance and formatting of HTML elements by defining styles such as colors, fonts, and layout.
Basic Structure of an HTML Document: An HTML document typically consists of the following basic structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Title of the Document</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
HTML Elements vs. Attributes: HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents, represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets, such as <p> for paragraphs or <img> for images. Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are placed within the opening tag, such as src for specifying the image source in an <img> tag.
2. Comprehension
• Explain the purpose and usage of common HTML elements (e.g., <head>, <body>,
<p>) and attributes.
• Describe the significance of links, tables, and forms in HTML.
• Analyze the role of inline styling in HTML.
Task
• Create a simple HTML document with various elements, attributes, and inline styles.
• Write a short paragraph explaining the purpose of each element used.
Ans:
Purpose and Usage of Common HTML Elements and Attributes:
•	<head>: Contains metadata about the document, including title, links to external resources, and scripts.
•	<body>: Contains the content of the document, such as text, images, and multimedia.
•	<p>: Represents a paragraph of text.
•	Attributes like href in <a> tags are used to specify the destination of hyperlinks.
Significance of Links, Tables, and Forms in HTML:
•	Links (<a>): Allow users to navigate between different web pages or sections within the same page.
•	Tables (<table>): Used to organize and display data in rows and columns.
•	Forms (<form>): Enable users to input data, such as text, selections, or file uploads, which can be submitted to a server for processing.
Role of Inline Styling in HTML: Inline styling allows you to apply styles directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. It offers flexibility but can lead to code duplication and maintenance challenges.
3. Application
• Demonstrate the ability to create hyperlinks, tables, and forms in an HTML document.
• Apply inline styling to modify the appearance of HTML elements.
Task
• Develop a webpage that includes hyperlinks, tables, and a form with various input
types.
• Customize the appearance using inline styling.
Ans:
Demonstration of Hyperlinks, Tables, and Forms:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
            <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
            <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <form>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
Customization Using Inline Styling:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Styled Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;">This is a styled paragraph.</p>
    <div style="background-color: yellow; padding: 10px;">Styled Div</div>
</body>
</html>
4. Analysis
• Evaluate the importance of HTML page layouts.
• Compare and contrast different types of HTML form elements.
Task
• Write a brief analysis of the impact of effective page layouts on user experience.
• Create a table comparing different HTML form elements based on their functionality.
Ans:
Importance of HTML Page Layouts: Effective page layouts enhance readability, navigation, and user experience by organizing content logically and aesthetically. Well-designed layouts contribute to user engagement and satisfaction.
Comparison of HTML Form Elements: Different form elements serve various purposes, such as text input (<input type="text">), checkboxes (<input type="checkbox">), radio buttons (<input type="radio">), dropdown menus (<select>), and file uploads (<input type="file">). Each element has unique characteristics suited for specific data input scenarios.
5. Synthesis
• Integrate HTML and CSS concepts to create a well-structured webpage.
• Design a webpage layout using CSS.
Task
• Develop a webpage that incorporates CSS for styling and layout.
• Include a variety of HTML elements to showcase the integration of HTML and CSS.
Ans:
Integration of HTML and CSS: Combining HTML and CSS enables the creation of visually appealing and well-structured webpages. CSS is used to style HTML elements, control layout, and enhance the overall presentation of content.
Webpage Layout Design Using CSS:

            color: white;
            padding: 20px;
            text-align: center;
